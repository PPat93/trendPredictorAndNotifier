"""
RSI hex:
Calculates The Relative Strength Index for a given stock ticker.
The given time intervals will be used to determine the range of calculations.
Window parameter defines how much the old data influences the new data. 
    - Scientificly: Specifies decay in terms of center of mass. 
    - The larger the window, the greater the influence of older data on newer data.
Worth using with other ratios - great with MACD.
Base calculations are given in the comment. However, the Ta-Lib library was used 
for the calculations.
